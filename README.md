New Spades
===========
This game is developed by KingEik and HendrikF.
It consists of a client and a server and is inspired by the old Beta version (0.75) of [Ace of Spades](http://buildandshoot.com/).
It is in pre-alpha state.
Dependencies may change or be included in future.

Running the game
-----------------
To run the client use:

    ./newspades.py

To run the server use:

Keep in mind, that this is in pre-alpha state! We cannot guarantee that every commit is stable or that the version of the client matches the server.

To run the game you need to install:

* Python 3.2 or newer: https://www.python.org/download/

(We tested with 3.2 and 3.4)
